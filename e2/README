Exercise 2
----------

Programming
Build a program (in any language) for repetitive network scans displaying differences between
subsequent scans.
- scan can be executed either using external tools or using dedicated libraries of selected
programming language
- target of the scan must be parametrized as CLI argument
- target can be single IP address as well as network range

Example of expected result:

Initial scan:
$ ./scanner 10.1.1.1
*Target - 10.1.1.1: Full scan results:*
Host: 10.1.1.1 Ports: 22/open/tcp////
Host: 10.1.1.1 Ports: 25/open/tcp////
Repetitive scan with no changes on target host:

$ ./scanner 10.1.1.1
*Target - 10.1.1.1: No new records found in the last scan.*
Repetitive scan with changes on target host:

$ ./scanner 10.1.1.1
*Target - 10.1.1.1: Full scan results:*
Host: 10.1.1.1 Ports: 22/open/tcp////
Host: 10.1.1.1 Ports: 25/open/tcp////
Host: 10.1.1.1 Ports: 80/open/tcp////
